# Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a robust and accurate price prediction model for ridesharing services, specifically targeting Uber and Lyft. The goal is to create a model that can estimate the fare for a ride based on various factors such as distance, time, location, and potential surge pricing for the Boston dataset. 


# Model Used
- Ridge and Lasso Regression
- Random Forest
- XG Boost



# Optimization and Hyper-Parameter Tuning
Bagging regressor was applied to XGboost to resample the data and run the simulations with 5-Fold Cross validation using Sci-kit's GridSearchCV. Tuning params were as below:

```
tuning_params = {
"n_estimators": [x for x in range(50, 400, 50)],
"max_depth": [3,6,9],
"gamma": [0.01, .1],
"learning_rate": [.001, .01, .1, 1]
}
```

The led to increase in accuracy by 2% resulting into total accuracy of 96.9%.
